A LKL and APR based FTP daemon.

APR:
	to build it you'll need libapr1 http://apr.apache.org/
	on Ubuntu/Debian just do: apt-get install libapr1-dev
	documentation about the library API: http://apr.apache.org/docs/apr/1.2/modules.html

LKL:
	it's not used currently. I'm just trying to get the FTP daemon to work with native files.
	After I'll get this done, I'll add LKL calls.

Design:
	The main thread waits for connection on a given port.
	Each accepted connection is handled on a separate thread.
	Data relevant to the connection is held in a lfd_sess structure,
	and a pointer to this structure is passed to all functions
	called from the connection loop.
