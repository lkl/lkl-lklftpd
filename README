A LKL and APR based FTP daemon.

APR:
	to build it you'll need libapr1 http://apr.apache.org/
	on Ubuntu/Debian just do: apt-get install libapr1
	documentation about the library API: http://apr.apache.org/docs/apr/1.2/modules.html
	
LKL:
	it's not used currently. I'm just trying to get the FTP daemon to work with native files.
	After I'll get this done, I'll add LKL calls.
